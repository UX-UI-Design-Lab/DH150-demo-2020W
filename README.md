# The Glass Bead Game 
## DH150 UX Design, Sookyung Cho

## What is the Glass Bead Game?
This project inivolves the mobile app user user experience design for the community with the similar aesthetical taste. 

## Design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

## Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02]:
To me, the idea of community is rooted in bringing people together, so both of my websites are related to the public libraries that I would frequent as a child. I chose these websites because libraries offer valuable community resources for free, such as books, internet access, and homework help.
